        <title>A very long drive in Kenya</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/barrkenyaface.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;barrkenya&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had been camping in the desert for about 6 weeks doing paleontological fieldwork, and we were driving back to Nairobi, Kenya.
The drive had been plenty rough on the way up, but 6 weeks later the Land Rovers were in worse shape and we had to stop to fix a lot of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This photo was taken perhaps 8 hours into what turned into a nearly 20 hour day.  I was tired and hungry and my beard was just unbelievably dusty.
Turns out you can style your beard in fun ways when it is like this!&lt;/p&gt;
