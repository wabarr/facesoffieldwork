Faces of Fieldwork highlights researchers doing fieldwork. We focus on the personal stories of people doing sometimes unglamorous work. We may have dirt in our faces, but we love what we do. 

You are welcome to [submit your own]({{site.contributeURL}}) photos and stories.

## Origin Story

Faces of fieldwork began during a long drive in northwestern Kenya. At a rest-stop, I happened to look at myself in the side mirror and noted that my field beard was looking particularly grizzly. I posted this photo on Facebook with the caption "Faces of Fieldwork", and the rest is history.
