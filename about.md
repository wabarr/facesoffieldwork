			<p>Faces of Fieldwork highlights researchers doing sometimes unglamorous work. FOF is gathering personal reflections on what fieldwork means to fieldworkers, as well as amusing anecdotes of fieldwork gone wrong (#fieldworkfail)!</p>

			<p>FOF began during a long drive in northwestern Kenya. At a rest-stop, I happened to look at myself in the side mirror and noted that my field beard was looking particularly grizzly. I posted this photo on Facebook with the caption "Faces of Fieldwork", and the rest is history.</p>
