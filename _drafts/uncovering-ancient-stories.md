I am a PHD Student from the National School of Anthropology and History (ENAH) where I received my masterâ€™s degree in Physical Anthropology with a specialization in ancient migration. I am a specialist in bioarchaeological research and also in the analysis and digitization of funerary contexts.

In the picture, I am digging the remains of a foreign woman possibly from the Maya Area. In this project as a team, we uncover many graves of foreign people in the ancient city of Teotihuacan. Currently I am doing research on foodways and human mobility.
