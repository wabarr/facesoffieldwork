I'm an ecologist and I recently graduated with my Masters! I worked with the phenomenal [Dr. Shannon Pelini](http://Pelinilab.wordpress.com) and had the opportunity to explore forest floor invertebrates in the rainforests of Hawaii! I was interested in how available nutrients in the leaf litter/soil could affect which invertebrates where there and how active they were at decomposing the leaves. 

Working in the Hawaiian rainforest was a wild time. We ran into a invasive boars multiple times. Though the scariest time was when we came across a baby boar and did not know where mom was. Luckily we never found out! This picture was taken on our last day in the field. I was overcoming an illness and was just relieved to have been able to finish my project. It was an incredibly adventure and I couldn't have done it without Dr. Pelini, Dr. Litton, and Dr. Giardina! 

Now I'm pursuing interest in science communication through my podcast Bugs&Stuff and trying to find my next adventure!
