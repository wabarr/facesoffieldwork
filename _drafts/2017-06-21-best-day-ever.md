I am a PhD student at the University of Southern Mississippi. My project is to catch America's largest turtle, the Alligator Snapping Turtle, to see where they are found and how many there are. Today was our best day yet, with not one but two Alligator Snappers in a single trap! I introduce to you 1st place (right) and 3rd place (left) for the heaviest turtles we have captured so far, weighing in at 61.7 and 50 pounds respectively. We were not expecting to pull 112 pounds of turtles out of a single trap! We believe the big boy followed the smaller lady into the trap for... you know.
