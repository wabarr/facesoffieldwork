This photo was taken in February 2010, at one of my favorite places in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, where I have had the unique privilege to study chimpanzees for many years.  Locally known as "Hilltop," this area of miombo woodland is open and shady.  It is common for Kasekela chimpanzees to take a short siesta when passing through.  It is also a site where, over the last several decades, a growing subset of the community have been seen to 'fish' for carpenter ants (*Camponotus sp.*) using tools.

I had come back to Gombe at the end of my pre-wedding Tanzanian honeymoon with my wife, and wasn't really expecting to take any data that day...but when I saw them approaching the 'ant tree' I just couldn't resist.
