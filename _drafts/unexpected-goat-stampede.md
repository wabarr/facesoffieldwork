Mind the goats!

Fieldwork is full of surprises! I was on my own in the Turkana desert in Kenya, concentrating on surveying the ground for fossils when I felt the ground moving. As I lifted my head, hundreds of goats came running at me from out of nowhere and I found myself in the middle of an unexpected goat stampede. I was startled, but not to the point of missing the perfect occasion for a selfie... I also met the shepherds several minutes later, two young Kenyan girls who were probably even more surprised to see me there.
