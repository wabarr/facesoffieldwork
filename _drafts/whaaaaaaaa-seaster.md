Texas high-school science teacher Kimberly Hendrix (pictured, with permission) joined my field crew in 2009 (and 2013 & 2014) on Vancouver Island, studying stickleback evolution. She was funded by NSF DEB Research Experience for Teachers (RET). Near the end of the 6-week trip we took a day off to go tide-pooling on Quadra Island. This was the first moment that Kim held a *Pycnopodia* seastar. The rocky shoreline by Village Bay used to hold innumerable *Pisaster* and *Pycnopodia*, but in recent years a wasting disease has decimated the population. They are basically absent.
