My fieldwork for my PhD was done at Carrie Bow Cay, the Smithsonian's field station in Belize. A lot of my time there is spent snorkelling and looking for mantis shrimp (I research visual communication in mantis shrimp). Every time before I head to Belize, my Dad warns me that I'm not allowed to dive or snorkel near any sharks. So when I saw this nurse shark swimming around the island, I knew I had to get a selfie.  Next time I'll try to snap one while I'm in the water! Read more about my research [on my website](http://amandafranklin.wixsite.com/home).
