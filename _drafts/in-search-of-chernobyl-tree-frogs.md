On April 23 1986 the reactor number 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded creating [the most severe radioactive accident in human history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster). During May 2017, together with my colleague Pablo Burraco (EBD-CSIC, Spain), I conducted my second season of fieldwork inside Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in order to examine the impact that living in a radioactive contaminated area has on the physiology, development and genetics of amphibians, using the Eastern treefrog (<i>Hyla orientalis</i>) as our study model.
