I am doing my masterâ€™s degree in Anthropology department at Istanbul University, Turkey. I am studying captive chimpanzee behaviors in the zoo but first, I was thinking to go Kenya and understand the behavior of colobus monkeys who are a prey for chimpanzees. You know, my chimpanzees in the zoo have never seen, eaten and hunted these animals. I was curious what are they missing? Then, I have worked as a volunteer researcher for 3 months in Kenya with conservation organization designed to promote conservation, preservation, and protection of primates and its coastal forest habitat in southern Kenya. This photo was taken after a few hours I had searched them in the bushes and finally found them top of the water tank.
