On my very first day of my master's fieldwork I was ten miles down a dirt logging road approaching my third and last site of the day when I stopped to consider a large mud puddle. I'd made it through seemingly worse so I gunned it to try and skim over but, alas, this mud was more liquid than its brethren and I sank to the axles. My brother and I (my bro had come to visit, this was his first day in AK) spent two hours trying to dig the car out while my supervisor came to rescue us. The super's giant truck got stuck as we were leaving. Pictured above, we spent another three hours trying to dig it out, eventually being rescued by ATV. We went back the next day with 100ft of metal cable and pulled the vehicles out with a bulldozer.
