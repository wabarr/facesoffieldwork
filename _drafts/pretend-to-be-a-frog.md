I am a Peace Corps Volunteer in Peru. I am working with a community based conservation area the ACP-Copallin and a state run conservation area the Santuario Nacional Cordillera de Colan, on a camera trapping to produce both educational materials and create a more complete list of mammals for both conservation areas. As illustrated in this photo we test to make sure the cameras are well placed by pretending to be animals passing in front of them. Here I was pretending to be a frog. The community members, especially those who helped us place cameras, love seeing footage from their forest. This has not only been wonderful for local awareness but we have added two new mammals and one new bird to the species list for the ACP-Copallin.
