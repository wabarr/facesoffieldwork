Sometimes the most beautiful fossils come from the dirtiest places. In 2015, I was on a tour of fossil localities in the highlands of Peru when we stopped at the small oil town of Yauri. However, our destination was not actually Yauri, but the local trash site that was located just on the outskirts of town. We hit this spot right at sun down, and after wading through the massive piles of trash we made it to the limestone quarry that was rumored to contain beautifully preserved Miocene fish and plants. This photo is documentation of that search.
