Fieldwork means - no time for maternity photos! I was measuring and marking desert iguanas 2 days before my son was born - you don't need to walk too fast to noose a lizard with a fishing pole (don't worry, it doesn't hurt them). Working in the desert is often difficult, often hot, ALWAYS SANDY, but wonderful. I can't wait for my son to join me in the field someday!
