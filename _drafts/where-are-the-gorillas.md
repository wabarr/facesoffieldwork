This picture was taken in the Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda, while tracking mountain gorillas.

Tracking these primates every day can be difficult, even for experienced trackers, and sometimes you can get lost! This day in particular we got lost for a while in Kupoteza area, which literally means “loss” or “waste” in Kiswahili...Apparently Dian Fossey herself also got lost in this area sometimes trying to look for the gorillas!
