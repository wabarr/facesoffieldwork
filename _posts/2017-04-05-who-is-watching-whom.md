This picture was taken while I was conducting an all-day follow on a 30 g African striped mouse. That's right....I wasn't watching the gemsbok (*Oryx gazella*), but a tiny mouse. The gemsbok was trying to get to the waterhole next to me and he was watching me for a couple of hours, trying to get closer the water when I wasn't looking at him. Water is scarce in the Succulent Karoo during the dry season. He did not leave but stayed until I was done with my data collection for the day. While it's really lovely to have the gemsboks and other big antelopes around, these long horns can be intimidating when pointed at you!
