I'm a systematist and evolutionary biologist studying fishes. Here I am in the mangroves of coastal Tanzania after a day of collecting animals with seines and other nets. Near the end of the day we saw mudskippers: fishes that have adapted to come on to land. They are hard to catch, they burrow in the mud when they are being chased, so you have to get deep in the mud to get them. It's hard work but fun; and messy. The DNA and morphology of these animals can help us better understand the evolutionary history of Gobiiformes - the hyper-diverse lineage they belong to.
