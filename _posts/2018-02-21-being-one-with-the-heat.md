My fieldwork with the Shuar — a forager-horticulturalist group in the Amazon — usually means camping out, off the grid, in 90°+ humidity. During my first trip, my field adviser shared a pearl of wisdom with me. "Be one with the heat," he suggested. "Don't fight it". Over time, I figured out just how useful that advice is, and not just for heat, but for all the challenges of fieldwork... like insect bites. More wise advice on that front: "One of your goals," he said, "is to get  the optimal number of bug bites; not so few that you feel each one, but not so many that you can't do anything else". And you know what? He was right about that, too.
