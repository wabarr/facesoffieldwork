I am a Ph.D. student at Wake Forest University researching the role of landslides in Andean forest ecology. I've been in the field all summer working with my all-female field team to gather preliminary data on the species composition of regenerating landslides across a variety of elevations and landslide ages and sizes. I'm on the bottom left. In the bottom right is Flor, from Cusco, Peru, and in the top of the frame is Rachel from Appalachian State University, USA. Sampling on the landslides is challenging, but we are rewarded with amazing views from the top and the knowledge that we are likely standing where no other humans ever have.
