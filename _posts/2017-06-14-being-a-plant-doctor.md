Plant pathology diagnosticians are to plants what general practitioners are for people - we spend our time asking questions about symptoms, general health, and then we figure out what's going wrong and what can be done about it.  We're the people that get excited about leaf spots, wilted plants, dead flowers, and fungi on trees, all in the name of supporting our growers so you have plenty of food and a beautiful plant world around you.
