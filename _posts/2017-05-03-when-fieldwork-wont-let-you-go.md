After an eight week field season that involved our first field school, desperate country-wide fuel shortages, a fire at the filling station, digging at least three sites (including a massive 50x4m trench with a backhoe), and a bit of a run-in with some local thugs, this field director was ready to get herself and her three-year-old son back to her "other" life. But on the way out of town, massive engine failure resulted in many hot hours spent on the side of the road making a plan to escape. To this day, the blue bus (seen here with the rear propped up with a total station pole) is still stranded in Karonga. Read more about my research [here](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/jcthompson/).
