I am a biologist who has loved carrion since I was five. I have spent ten consecutive years conducting fieldwork to assess the damage caused by large cats on livestock in three different Brazilian biomes. On this day, I was checking a calf killed by a jaguar on a cattle ranch in the Amazon forest. When I find a suspect carcass, I usually examine it for internal and external injuries caused by bites and scratches, particularly in the skull, neck and limbs, in order to determine the predator. Diseases, malnutrition and accidents cause much more livestock mortality than predation, which does not exceed 3% of the total stock. Even so, breeders usually use livestock losses as a reason to justify persecution of large cats. I am also interested in understanding the importance of these predators from a human perspective, evaluating the potential for conflict among different stakeholders.
