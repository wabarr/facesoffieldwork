This picture was taken at the end of a long day searching for my missing study group. They had moved elsewhere to range and we were trying to find them for many days. Basically, we spent the entire day driving to different spots, searching, walking around, etc.  At the end of a long day (12ish hours), I climbed up on the car to get a bit higher (and goof off a little), trying to look along a river to see if we could spot any baboons heading towards the many trees alongside it.
