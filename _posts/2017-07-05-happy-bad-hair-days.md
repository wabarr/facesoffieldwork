Field work involves forgetting about daily grooming and focusing all your senses toward the natural world. 

As PhD student, I am interested in the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying patterns in community assembly.  I am motivated to study such mechanisms by the spectacular diversity of fishes found in the littoral reefs of Lake Tanganyika. Most of my field work involves spending many hours underwater doing scuba diving, hence the permanent bad hair. However, I smile constantly because fishes -particularly fishes from the family Cichlidae- never seize to amaze me with unique parental care strategies and natural histories, that so few people have witnessed! In this photo, I am holding a Sleek lates fish (*Lates stappersi*) caught by local Tanzanian fishermen. This photo is also a reminder that human populations rely on this invaluable yet fragile lacustrine ecosystem.
