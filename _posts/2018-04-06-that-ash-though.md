Born in Newcastle, northern Kwazulu Natal, I have always been curious about the world around me and how it has been shaped. I pursued a career in the sciences and now hold a BSc (Geology, Archaeology and Environmental & Geographical sciences) from the University of Cape Town, a BSc Honours (Geology and Palaeontology) from Wits and has just recently completed his MSc in Geology from the same university. During this time I have gained more training as a Koobi Fora Field-school fellow (Kenya) as well as an Erasmus Mundus scholar (Toulouse and Bordeaux, France). I am a Plio-Pleistocene geologist with a specific focus on identifying and explaining past environments that are associated with early human life and development through time. I am interested in a wide range of disciplines such as micromorphology, sedimentology, geochemistry, geochronology and stratigraphy. I have worked with teams from significant eastern and southern African hominid sites including Elandsfontein, Sterkfontein, Gondolin, Laetoli, Olduvai and Koobi Fora. I plan to extend my knowledge from both parts of the continent to assist the better understanding of how we as humans came to being. I have also conducted some research in the the Permian Karoo Basin of South Africa. 

I am  also really passionate about science education and science communication in the larger South African community as evident in my involvement with the Institute for Digital Education, the Economic Policy and Research Institute, Soroptimist and the South African Education Program. 

I just joined Geosciences as a PhD student as supervised by Dr. Zubair Jinnah where we will conduct research on palaeoenvironmental reconstruction and change of the Turkana Basinâ€™s Plio-Pleistocene, Northern Kenya and how this change has driven hominin evolution.

This picture basically sums up what I do in a field season and its the reason why paleoanthropologists hate us and love us. We can tell them so much about the context of their fossil finds but we bring these hammers (basically make us feel like Thor) that could smash a potential find. I was trying to follow the stratigraphic unit so had to make myself a fresh section to see if I am still at the right layer. This one was a lot more fun because all I had to do is make sure I am seeing a yellow tuffaceous ash layer (termed, as you can guess, the yellow marker tuff).
