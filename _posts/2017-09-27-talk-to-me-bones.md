My fieldwork in Georgia involves excavating and analyzing human bones from medieval graves. Physical anthropology is not widely practiced in this part of the world, so I am glad to also give a summer school to archaeology students. 

So far, I have focused on population health, and the use of sacred burial space in Christianity. I hope to contribute to historical knowledge about Georgia by learning about the daily practices of rural populations, whether it be through occupational markers or dietary habits.

It is exciting and challenging to immerse myself in an emerging field. The most rewarding moments are when I see students learning and engaging with the work with the same passion as me!
