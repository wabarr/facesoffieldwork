The only way to monitor environmental changes is to know what an ecosystem holds in the first place! I have spent the past 3 years doing biodiversity monitoring with NGOs in Peru and Honduras, and have just started my Masters studying Lepidoptera in northern Mexico. This photo shows a Ring-necked coffee snake (*Ninia diademata*) that I caught on one of many wet, mosquitoey night surveys in Honduras. 

One of the best parts of biodiversity monitoring is how relevant it is to society. As scientists, not only do we get to do the messy field work part, but it's also on us to monitor long-term changes in the environment and to help communicate our results to governments, businesses and communities to affect social, political and economic change. The implications of this science are complicated and far-reaching, and working in these geographic areas makes it clear to me that environmental conservation cannot exist without transparent politics, social justice and economic equality.
