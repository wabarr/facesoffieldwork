I'm a paleontologist and Collections Manager at the Mace Brown Museum of Natural History at the College of Charleston and am currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in Museum Studies at the University of Leicester, UK.
I grew up in Montana and studied paleontology at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana. When I was a freshman at MSU I volunteered for the Museum of the Rockies preparing and cleaning fossils before ultimately being hired to work in collections and the histology lab at MOR, curating the osteological collections and assisting in paleohistological work. After finishing at MSU I moved to California briefly before moving to New Zealand for 3 years and currently calls Charleston, South Carolina home. 

At the College of Charleston I am the Outreach Coordinator for the Geology Department and actively engage with the public doing outreach events with the Museum and teaching the public about the plethora of fossils that can be found locally, and promoting women in science. I've done fieldwork in northern Montana with MOR uncovering dinosaurs from the Cretaceous Judith River Formation as well as work in the Mio-Pliocene Purisima Formation on the central coast of California. In this picture, I was exploring a Cretaceous patch reef in North Carolina collecting invertebrate fossils for the Mace Brown Museum, and it had been a very long, hot, and dirty day - a nap was inevitable.

My research interests include pinniped evolution, biogeography and functional morphology. [Learn more about paleontology research on the blog of the Mace Brown Museum of Natural History](http://blogs.cofc.edu/macebrownmuseum/).
