I'm afraid of heights-- there, I said it.  But I'm a geologist, and I need to go where the rocks are.  So, it was time to climb!  After 3 weeks in the field in the remote reaches of Kenya, dreading the hike to the top of the cliffs to sample a basalt flow, I dove in and just did it.  With the help of my research student (who was an avid rock climber and who kept reminding me "three points of contact at all times!"), I made it.  What a view of Turkana!  (And we got about 30 lbs of basalt samples, too.)  The geology at this site is helping to reconstruct what the landscape looked like almost 19 million years ago, when our primate ancestors first started to diversify in East Africa. Stay tuned...we hope to publish our findings soon!
