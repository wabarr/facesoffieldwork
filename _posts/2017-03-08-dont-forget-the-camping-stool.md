I spent the entirety of my second trimester pregnant with my now 5 year old son in the field in central Kenya, studying modern bones. I think the hardest part of that entire experience was having to bend over every morning and afternoon to pull on my gaiters and hiking boots - well, not to mention getting down to the ground over and over again to examine the bones on the ground! I ended up bringing a little folding camping stool with me to the field to sit on to take notes; that really helped ease the discomfort.
