I'm a graduate student at Georgia Southern University studying bipedal locomotion in lizards! Its hot and dry in Ocala, perfect weather for catching lizards. Ocala has amazing longleaf and scrub habitat with an abundance of racerunners and scrub lizards. Here, I am getting ready to explore a longleaf stand in search of these lizards. I'm convinced the hat and straw help me blend in to the natural habitat! When I can't carry any more lizards, I head back to GSU where the real work begins: sprint trials.

I film lizards running bipedally down a race track to try and understand the mechanisms underlying facultative bipedalism. Specifically, how do the position of the forelimbs effect their body center of mass as they run bipedally.
