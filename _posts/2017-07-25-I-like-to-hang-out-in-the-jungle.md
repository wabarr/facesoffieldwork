Research in the rainforest has usually been done in a 2D plane, forgetting that most of the biodiversity is in the third dimension. I get to climb trees and study the birds and mammals that wander cryptically across the branches, unseen. We set cameras in the rainforest canopy to monitor these animals for months, learning about their behavior, their use of the trees, and even discovering new species records in some areas! As this method has only been used recently, all the information we gather is valuable and potentially new to science. Read more about my research [on my website](https://diegoblb.wordpress.com/).
