*Note from photographer*: This photo was taken after six long weeks of paleoanthropological fieldwork in the desert of northwestern Kenya. Russ didn't know he was being photographed in this photo...it was a candid capture when we stopped our caravan to deal with a vehicle engine problem. 

In Koobi Fora, inevitably there comes a time to shake out the dust!
