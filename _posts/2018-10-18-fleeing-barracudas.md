Fieldwork is always subject to complications and difficulties and the major work of a field scientist is to plan and overcome these challenges. Sometimes things don't happen as they should and very rarely they lead to the scientist fleeing...

I conducted a study on rocky reefs on the coast of Gabon. For this study, I conducted fieldwork by freediving and doing some experiments in the water. Gabon has quite turbid water at the coast where I was and visibility was often under 1.5m, which is not a big problem if you adapt your protocol. (My aim was to assess the presence of small predators.) Reliably avoiding stingrays, jellyfish and heavy driftwood moving in the waves while not seeing anything turns out to be...complicated. However, the day I fled was the day I had optimal field conditions. About 10-15m of visibility and no waves, just perfect. I have to admit that I had quite a bad day since I almost stepped on a mamba (snake) and being farther than 2h of the next hospital this would have been a certain death. But good visibility compensated all the previous nervousness and agitation. Or did it? 

In the water, I was able to conduct some experiments, but suddenly I noticed some very large (1.5m) Barracudas in the bay. First, they stayed at a certain distance but they got closer and closer. At this point, you need to know that it was the first and only time I wasn't wearing diving fins because I had to carry heavy stuff from the beach into the water. One of the barracudas decided to get TOO close and to show me that it didn't like me. I tried to avoid it but having no fins, I wasn't quick enough. It charged me four times and tried to bite me. I swam as fast as I could but when you escape an attacking animal you always feel slow (especially without fins...why the hell did I leave them on the beach?). It chased me even in knee-deep water and waited for me in the shallows. Fortunately, apart from some scratches and a cut (probably from the barracuda's fins) I was unharmed. But I did NOT want to get back into this water. 

I was still missing some sample points and replicates for some experiments. I, however, entered my data into the computer. It was statistically sound, even without the missing measurements. So I took the next flight home to Europe...I fled back home.

The scariest thing about all this is a simple question: Were they there all around and I just didn't see me because of the turbidity? Or did they observe me without me knowing and I was just lucky being not attacked? I honestly don't want to know...
