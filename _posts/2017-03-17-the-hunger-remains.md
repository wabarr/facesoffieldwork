For me, summer fieldwork is the perfect antidote to an academic year spent in the classroom, the lab, and the office. Paleontology fieldwork involves some combination of binaries…adventure and routine, travel to far-away places and hours spent crawling around a few square meters of ground, new discoveries and days where you don’t find a thing worth collecting.  But mostly it’s about fellowship and collaboration, experiencing beautiful and remote places, working together for a common purpose, and getting to know people who, likely as not, will become life-long friends and colleagues. And for me it’s about the actual moment of discovering a beautiful fossil specimen…and the hunger for finding more! This picture captures me in the blissful moment right after I picked up a Miocene ape maxilla at Buluk, and realized that this is what we came halfway around the world in search of.  Satisfying? Sure, but the hunger remains.
