Over spring break, with a team of Tufts University biologists, I studied homing distances in stingless bees on a coffee farm in Costa Rica. Before we could study homing distances, we had to find where the bees lived! Above my head is a large stingless bee nest (which was a termite nest before it was a stingless bee nest).  You can read more about our study on [my website](https://www.rachaelebonoan.com/single-post/2017/04/03/Spring-break-in-Costa-Rica). (Can you tell I was travelling to Costa Rica from the Boston Area?)
