I'm an ecologist and conservation biologist who studies bats and works for a conservation non-profit - [Bat Conservation International](http://www.batcon.org/). My husband is a consulting biologist who also works with bats.  We've been conducting fieldwork together for almost 20 years.  Our son has been a part of our field work since he was an infant.  At age 7, he's an important part of our field team and loves cave surveys and bat trapping. Read more about my research [here](http://frick.eeb.ucsc.edu/).
