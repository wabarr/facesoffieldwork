I am a geologist and geochemist who works on understanding how you make mountains, and what happens to rocks when you bury them under 10's of kilometres of other rock and subject it to high temperatures and pressures. So what better place to study this than the greatest mountain range on earth today, the Himalaya?! See my research profile [here](http://www.open.ac.uk/people/sp25673).

This photo was taken in Eastern Bhutan as part of my 4-week PhD field season in 2017. I travelled from the high peaks up in the NW of Bhutan, to the lush forests in the East, all in search of kyanite-bearing leucogranites (former molten rocks containing the beautiful blue mineral kyanite). Bringing these rocks back to the UK to The Open University where I am based, I will (hopefully!) be able to unravel some of the intricacies about how the Himalaya were formed. 

On my journey through Bhutan I saw amazing wildlife, met some of the loveliest people on the planet, and ate fabulous food. And to me, this is the best thing about being a geologist. Doing fieldwork allows you to travel to incredible places that you would never otherwise go, and experience things that most people don't get to. As well as doing some kickass science of course!

And I'm so passionate about the virtues of fieldwork, that a friend and I set up a podcast! [Fieldwork Diaries](www.fieldworkdiaries.com) is a place for people to tell their amazing stories of fieldwork, and help others who may be thinking about doing fieldwork or currently planning expeditions. We share the message that Faces of Fieldwork spread, so if you like it here, why not check out the podcast?!
