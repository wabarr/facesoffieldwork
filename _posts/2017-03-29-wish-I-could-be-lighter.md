We were snow tracking a wolf pack in a valley (~ 400 m a.s.l) and suddenly it changed direction to the main ridge at 1400 m a.s.l. Since it was Mid-April, we did not have the equipment for deep snow. Unfortunately, they went on the north face and the snow was nearly a meter deep. Being much lighter than we are, they were able to walk on top of the snow, but not us! We followed them for nearly three kilometres before abandoning the track (then walking as many kilometers before descending in altitude). We returned exhausted but with a lot of data!
