I am a Master's student and FTE studying the ecology of coastal fishes of the Great Lakes. Specifically, I focus on yellow perch and how they are supported by multiple habitats. A month before field season the PhD student I was working with decided to leave the program. I had to step it up and take over his grant funded project. It was such a scramble! The Great Lakes did not want to cooperate: I had to work around small craft advisories all summer and battled a lot of interesting weather in a flat bottom, nearly square boat. I was also sampling with limited help and suddenly one of my techs left for a more permanent position. Needless to say, I was a bit flustered, but super focused. So focused that a few months later as I am putting together posters, talks, etc I realized I had no photos of me in the field or of my study organism. All I could find were pics of my techs with just about every species of fish we caught, EXCEPT yellow perch. In the meantime my advisor hired me as a  FTE (still working on that master's!). I ended up in the field sampling for several other projects. One day we caught several large yellow perch in a wetland on Saginaw Bay and my coworker snapped this photo. At least when I get around to finishing that master's I'll have a pic with a nice, juicy yellow perch.
