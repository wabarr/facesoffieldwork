Everyone tells you that orangutans are an exciting bunch but alas they spend a lot of their day doing, well, not much. This photo was one of many taken when the orangutans decided to take a rest and the observers decided now was as good a time as any to perch on the leaf litter. My PhD research focuses how orangutans utilise oil palm in terms of their behaviour and ecology. As many as 80% of these animals are found outside of national parks, much of which is now oil palm. It is this new 'frontier' that is ever-expanding but totally under-researched, and this is why I'm back in West Kalimantan to study the effects of deforestation on orangutans.
