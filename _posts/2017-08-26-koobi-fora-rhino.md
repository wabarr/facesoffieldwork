Dr. Ashley Hammond, a paleoanthropologist at George Washington University, is holding a 2 million-year-old rhino mandible from the Koobi Fora Formation. Rhinos are relatively rare in the fossil record, so Dr. Hammond and her colleagues dedicated several hours to excavating this jaw. This fossil was found during the 2016 field season and will be prepared at the [National Museums of Kenya](http://www.museums.or.ke/), where it will also be stored for other researchers to study.  The paleontological work performed by Dr. Hammond, and her colleagues at the [Koobi Fora Field School](https://cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/koobi-fora-field-school), would not be possible without the help of Kenyan collaborators and assistants.
