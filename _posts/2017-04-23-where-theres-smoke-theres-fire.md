This was a photo taken during the fieldwork for my dissertation which concentrates on looking for fire in archaeological contexts. We only dig with small dental picks and sculpture tools, like you see here, to make sure we get as many small fragments of bone and stone as we can. It's hot and slow work, but the results we've so far have been worth it. Work is still ongoing at the site and we are looking into new methods to recover even more types of data from the site. Check out my newest project [here](https://experiment.com/projects/how-and-when-did-humans-start-using-fire).
