We were working at a new Plio-Pleistocene site in Ethiopia, and found some very nice primate fossils coming out of a very steep slope. We decided to use sieves to search through all the sediment nearby for any fossil bits we might have missed, but there was no flat area on the slope to do the sieving.  The local Afar guys we work with came up with the idea of doing a bucket line UP the hill, to the nearest flat place. They tossed the buckets from one person to the next, and never dropped a bucket!
