I'm an architecture and territorial sciences PhD student. I work on built heritage that has been restored and try to understand its effects on territorial development. I'm studying cases in Italy and France, which gives me the possibility to travel and discover lots of nice places. 

For example,  I stayed 6 months in Irpinia, a south Italian province. This photo was taken in Cairano, one of the village I study, while I took my sister on a tour there when she came for holidays. Cairano is a small town with 200 inhabitants and lots of houses are uninhabited, but since 2009, a group of people who "fell in love with the place" have decided to come one week each summer and animate the village with theatre lessons, building workshops, gardening competitions and so on. It brings the attention on the place and now some artists are buying houses and moving there ! Moreover, the municipality got some money to restore a part of the village that will become a theatre school and a restaurant. This way, we hope some students from all over the world will come here and give a new life to the charming streets of Cairano. 

For now, especially in winter, the town is really quiet and almost deserted ... so the inhabitants who see me walking around and taking pictures look at me with great big eyes every time,  wondering who the hell am I ! At times I tell my story and other times ... I keep up the mystery ;-) Read more about my work [here](
