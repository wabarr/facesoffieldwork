One warm day in March, we were out at the marsh catching gartersnakes as part of our annual monitoring. We normally catch all we can, put them in bags, and then process them at the end of the day. On this day, the weather turned quickly, and we went from sunny & warm to a hailstorm! I'm laughing in this picture because we were still processing the snakes in the hail, something I never thought I would do.
