My project is studying the spatial ecology and conservation biology of common snapping turtles. I'm in the middle of my field season, its only been 4 weeks but so far I've been bitten three times, almost had my field equipment lost in a flood and had my waders flooded daily! Even if you spend your entire winter planning, some things just can't be avoided. It's all worth it to help a species and their ecosystem.
