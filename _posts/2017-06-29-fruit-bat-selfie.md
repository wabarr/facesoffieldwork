I am a postdoctoral researcher, working on the evolution of developmental mechanisms leading to species diversity. And for that, I use neotropical bats as a model because they are incredibly diverse and show some very interesting adaptations of their visual and hearing system, as well as exhibiting a important molar shape diversity. 

Of course, before being able to work on bats, we have to go where they are to study them! This picture was taken in Puerto Rico, near the Mata de Platano field station where we always stay, in the middle of the jungle. It was about 1 or 2 in the morning, during one of the nights we were catching bats in mistnets between trees. This guy is a fruit bat, *Artibeus jamaicensis*, or the Jamaican fruit bat. Very common, but one of my favorites....just look at this face! His cave is just next door to the station and he probably flew back there after been released.
