Fieldwork allows a unique environmental perspective. At a scenic lakeshore locality in Panama, I am reminded that modern/ancient environments are both aesthetic and kinetic. Prior to discovering this gorgeous large echinoid (sea biscuit), thick vegetation was bushwhacked, snakes were avoided, and rabies shots were administered.
