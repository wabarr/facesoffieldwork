I was working with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources the summer of 2016 as a seasonal technician. We were collecting habitat data on the elk herds. This is a picture of me eating lunch... while hiding from mosquitoes in my hood... and standing in a puddle... in the rain. More fun than it sounds!
