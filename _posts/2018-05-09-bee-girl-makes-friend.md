In Portal, Arizona sits the Southwestern Research Station, tucked away in the Chiracahua Mountains. Every year, bee experts from the United States gather with a small group of bee-novices (myself included in the later category), to teach them how to collect, identify, and preserve their specimen at the annual Bee Course. 

The surrounding landscape is one of the most bee-diverse places in the world despite its barren appearance - you can hardly sweep a net without catching something flying by. But every once in a while, an aspiring melittologist (or bee scientist) will find another special friend. 

Running around in the crazed mid-day heat, my group stumbled upon a horned lizard. We paused for a brief respite to hydrate and admire the 'largest catch of the day' - who enjoyed sitting on the brim of my hat to soak up some summer sun. Photo by Stephen Buchmann.
