Fieldwork is all about making it work with what resources you have.  You are out in the middle of nowhere, often very far from any opportunity for re-supply or help.  We use flags to mark fossils that we find on survey, and I didn't have any way to carry the flags as I picked them up. So I made it work by feeding them through the rivets on my trusty field hat -- which I have had for 10+ years and still wear. I also made that t-shirt work for many years -- it used to be my favorite, but I just had to retire it. It had too many holes in it and I now have to be a "grown-up" since I am no longer a grad student. 

This photo is a reminder to myself to always try to make things work with the resources I have available.  It's also a good reminder that no matter how much we love our research and how important it is to us, we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously to have a laugh.
