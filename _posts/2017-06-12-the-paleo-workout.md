Rain is fun! At the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology where I was Asst Curator, we do fieldwork in Utah in Grand Staircase Escalante every summer (BLM land). Rain showers roll through every afternoon, but this one caught us while we were out at the site. This is our crew, (still in good spirits!) after hiking 6 miles back in wet clothing, having trudged through bentonite (volcanic ash) which makes each of your boots 5 lbs heavier! Needless to say, it was a good workout!
