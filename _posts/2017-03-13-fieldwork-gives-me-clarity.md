I remember seeing Lake Turkana for the first time. I had read about it, knew about the fossils and formations but I was so unprepared for its beauty.  Standing on the hill overlooking the lake, with the wind buffeting me and and with dirt in my mouth, I knew I had made the right decision in choosing to study archaeology. 

Fieldwork gives me a kind of clarity I didn’t know existed. Its hard work, the food is mostly bread, the math is confusing, and the days are long, but when I curl up in my sleeping bag at night I feel completely and utterly content. I haven’t found that kind of fulfillment anywhere else.
