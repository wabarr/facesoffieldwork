I typically have a beard, but I keep it pretty short. We had been camping in the desert for about 6 weeks doing paleontological fieldwork, and we were driving back to Nairobi, Kenya. The drive had been rough on the way up, but now 6 weeks later the Land Rovers were in worse shape and we were stopping a lot to fix a lot of things. 

This photo was taken perhaps 8 hours into what turned into a nearly 20 hour day.  I was tired and hungry and my beard was just unbelievably dusty. I love the way it flares out around the chin. I wish I had the guts to wear it like this in my "real" life.
