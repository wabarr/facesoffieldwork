We had been camping in the desert for about 6 weeks doing paleontological fieldwork, and we were driving back to Nairobi, Kenya.
The drive had been plenty rough on the way up, but 6 weeks later the Land Rovers were in worse shape and we had to stop to fix a lot of things. 

This photo was taken perhaps 8 hours into what turned into a nearly 20 hour day.  I was tired and hungry and my beard was just unbelievably dusty.
Turns out you can style your beard in fun ways when it is like this!
