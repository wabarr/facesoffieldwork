I first fell in love with biology and field work when I jumped into the deep end with the Kluane Squirrel Project [@KluaneSquirrels](http://twitter.com/@KluaneSquirrels) as an undergrad. Having done nothing of the kind before, I committed myself to 4 months in a remote camp in Canada's north, climbing trees to retrieve squirrel pups from their nests with little more than a good pair of gloves and some gosh darn gumption. It's hard to turn your career anywhere else once you've snuggled up to some fuzzy one-month old squirrels, though! Read more about my research [here](https://sarahnason.wordpress.com).
