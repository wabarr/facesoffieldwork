I am currently an independent researcher studying snow leopards in different regions of western Mongolia with different field partner organizations. Many of the survey sites I work in have very little data on the snow leopard populations. My teams trek these unknown areas to record what signs we find from the cats ( like the scrape I'm showing in the above photo) and collect scat that is then used to analyze for DNA, diet, and microbiota. 

Another research interest that I am becoming more involved with includes the multi-discipline field of One Health, where broad aspects of the well being of wildlife, humans, and domestic animals are linked together in an ecosystem as a whole. This can range from zoonoses to human-wildlife conflict. Read more about my research [on my website](
