The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has been regulating, studying, and conserving the Chinook salmon fishery diligently for ages. Since the late 70s, crews have been sampling a portion of the lower Kenai River; collecting population demographics of the Chinook salmon that can best represent the health and status of the fishery in accordance with the Sonar and Creel research teams. I grew up fishing the Kenai River relentlessly since before I fit into my first set of waders. Now as an adult, I work to protect the waters I call home as I am a senior at my four year university studying Wildlife Sustainability and Ecosystem Science, and looking to further my education afterwards.
