This photo is from a long-distance botany research trip....hunting the Ugandan baobab. We couldn't find anything to eat but fried grasshoppers! It was all worth it though, because we found the first record of baobabs in Uganda, which is important from an agro-eco and circa-situm conservation perspective.
