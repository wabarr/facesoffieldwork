We had spent hours and hours and hours and more countless hours on boats setting drumlines and gillnets with no success.  When we finally landed a blacktip for our research, it began to rain.  No, POUR.  Torrential downpour for hours.  The net was tangled, we gave up on trying to preserve the integrity of our foul weather gear, and we just got wet.  We were covered in pieces of monofilament, seagrass, macroalgae, and we were soaked to the bone.  But I honestly can't think of a more fun field day.  Field work is not comfortable.  But I would give my left arm to do fieldwork for the rest of my life.
