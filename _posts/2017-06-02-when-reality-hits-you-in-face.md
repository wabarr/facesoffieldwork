For a week I was using my heavy, metal geological hammer to bang the tubes we use for sediment collection into the loess section. Naturally I got pretty used to just how hard I needed to swing it, and it became an automatic action. The PhD student who was helping me out with fieldwork at the time argued that I would be better using a rubber mallet, as that would make the work easier. On my first attempt with the new tool I swung it with the same force as my geological hammer, not anticipating the amount of recoil I would get from the rubber mallet, which bounced back hard and hit me right in the middle of my forehead. This photo was taken just seconds after impact. I sported a purple-blue ring on my head for a few days after.
